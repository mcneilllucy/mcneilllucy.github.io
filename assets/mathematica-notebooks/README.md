# Mathematica notebooks

Welcome to my Mathematica notebooks page.

The purpose of most notebooks is to reproduce results in theoretical astrophysics peer reviewed papers interactively.

At the moment, there is

- Equilibrium tides model of Hut 1980 and Hut 1981
- Globular cluster modelling from Antonini and Gieles 2020

I hope that they are useful and that you enjoy using them.
