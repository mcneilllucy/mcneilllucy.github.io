# Notes

Welcome to my notes page.

It contains

- coursework notes I wrote over summer 2015-2016 for the unit Techniques for Modelling (advanced) at Monash University- MTH1035.
This is an advanced stream of the first year linear algebra & differential equations unit.

- notes including reviews and derivations of concepts in stellar hydrodynamics. Most of these are based on my PhD thesis.

- my personal cheat sheets for computing, related to Git and accessing clusters.
