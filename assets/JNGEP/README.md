# Japanese network for gender equality in physics (JNGEP)

The purpose of this network is to implement practical solutions to the problem of gender equality in physics in Japan.

The main goal is to quantitatively improve the proportion and retention of female and gender diverse undergraduate and graduate students in Physics.

This includes

- establishing professional mentorships to encourage and support students in grad school / job applications
- designing and implementing schemes to target gender equality at the faculty level
- social events at annual spring and autumn ASJ and JPS meetings (and more casual events at the city/campus level)
- outreach talks targeting high school students at high schools, science museums etc.
