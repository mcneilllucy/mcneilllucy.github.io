# Japanese network for gender equality in physics (JNGEP)

The purpose of this network is to implement practical solutions to the problem of gender equality in physics in Japan.

The main goal is to quantitatively improve the proportion and retention of female and gender diverse undergraduate and graduate students in Physics.

This includes

- establishing professional mentorships to encourage and support students in grad school / job applications
- designing and implementing schemes to target gender equality at the faculty level
- social events at annual spring and autumn ASJ and JPS meetings (and more casual events at the city/campus level e.g. sakura picnics)
- outreach talks targeting high school students at high schools, science museums etc.

## schemes to target gender equality in universities / research facilities

It is now a well-documented experience that minorities in physics are often socially isolated or discriminated by their peers based on their gender, e.g [1-5]

While Japanese universities and research institutes are already making efforts to make their faculty staff more gender diverse, the actual retention of students from high school to early career researcher level requires organised schemes.

### Increasing the number of students enrolling in masters courses

We encourage staff with teaching duties to systematically contact high achieving students in their undergraduate courses who are minorities, about considering applying for undergraduate research projects or graduate school. Or, if applicable, recommend or offer to introduce them to potential supervisors.

The reason is that these students are far less likely to consider graduate school at all (possibly due to the relative social isolation, disproportionate caring responsibilities etc.), despite having the equivalently strong grades as their male counterparts.

## social events

### Spring and Autumn physics workshops

There are two main societies which members of this network participate in. They are:

- Japan Physical Society (JPS)
<img src="/assets/images/jps-logo.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
- Astronomical Society of Japan (ASJ)
<img src="/assets/images/asj-logo.png" alt="drawing" width="150"/><img src="/assets/images/asj-logo-2.png" alt="drawing" width="150"/>

Annual autumn and spring meetings are held in September and March in different cities in Japan.
On one of the evenings, we will organise a dinner in a convenient location to the conference. Emails will be sent to the mailing list in August and February respectively, so please make sure you fill out the form if you are attending the workshop in person and would like to join the dinner.

* *In the event that a meeting is held online, we will arrange dinners in various cities anyway*

### Social picnic

Each year in early April, we currently organise sakura picnics in the following areas:

- Kyoto
<img src="/assets/images/kyoto.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="150"/>

- West Tokyo
<img src="/assets/images/tokyo.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="150"/>

- Saitama
<img src="/assets/images/saitama.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="150"/>

All members and supporters of JNGEP are invited to attend. An email will be sent to the mailing list
in February, so please make sure you fill out the form.

### Campus tea party or picnic during the masters course fair

If your lab participates in the annual masters recruitment fair, you can help JNGEP's goal to improve retention by simply printing the following leaflet (which contains a QR code to the [sign up page](https://forms.gle/X6Ao1CzzXMpLyrpZ8))

<img src="/assets/images/leaflet-v1-english.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

* *If you are signed up as a member or supporter working in a University, we will send a reminder each year.*

## outreach

Even at the undergraduate level, women and gender diverse people are a minority, and this proportion decreases towards graduate school.

### public lectures aimed at high school students

We therefore organise public lectures by members at local high schools and museums.
When women and gender diverse physicists are more publicly visible, and high school students can make contact with JNGEP, we hope that the gender-balance of students entering universities and continuing to study physics will increase.

If you are a high school teacher or museum staff who is interested in facilitating a general-audience lecture in physics by a JNGEP member, please contact the organisers at jngep + -at sign- + proton.me
